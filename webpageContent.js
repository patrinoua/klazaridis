  personalDescription: `
  A highly motivated Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering specialized in Fluid Dynamics with a
  particular interest on interface phenomena for coupled moving boundaries problems
  (wetting). My primary goal is to utilize my mathematical background in Partial Differential Equations to solve problems in Mathematical Physics.
  Specifically, current interests include:
  Mathematical formulation of physical processes, with particular interest in multiscale
  models and computational methods, and with applications in both, materials processing
  and service.
