  "displayName": "Contact line (wetting/non wetting) problem",
  "description": "In microgravity, brazing fluid can be transported to large distances and inaccessible locations. For example, the liquid fuel does not settle at the bottom of the tank where the nozzle which sucks the fuel is. Instead, due to surface tension, the fuel clings to the sides of the tank. Detecting exactly where the fuel can go is the primary goal of this project. The experimental and computational setup consists of two components. One vertical substate which attracts liquid (wetting surface) and one horizontal substrate which repels liquid (non-wetting) substrate. The motion of triple line (points where three phases coexist, i.e liquid-gas-solid) is our point of interest. For the numerical simulation we use the modified Navier-Stokes equations, introducing the surface tension forces along with a 4th order Partial Differential Equation (Cahn-Hilliard). The novelty of our technique lies on the derivation of a new diffusive boundary condition (phenomenological law) that can capture the motion of triple line accurately."
